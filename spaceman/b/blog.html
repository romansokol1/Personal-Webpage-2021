			<h3>2021-01-07 â€“ <a href="backflip.html"><u>How to Complete a Backflip</u></a></h3>
			<p>When I was around 10-12, the internet was booming with parkour compilations, I was reading comic books of superheroes doing these crazy stunts. Naturally, I became enticed by this, it would allow me to make friends and show off something cool. I taught myself some tricks like the backflip, the side-flip, and the front flip. The backflip I can still do, even after several months without trying, it's muscle memory.</p>
