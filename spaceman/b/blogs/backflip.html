	<h2>How to do the Backflip</h2>
	<p><small>Roman Sokol | 2021-01-07 </small></p>
	<p>When I was around 10-12, the internet was booming with parkour compilations, I was reading comic books of superheroes doing these crazy stunts. Naturally, I became enticed by this, it would allow me to make friends and show off something cool. I taught myself some tricks like the backflip, the side-flip, and the front flip. The backflip I can still do, even after several months without trying, it's muscle memory.</p>
	<p>Parkour or freerunning is an "extreme" sport, the premise of which is that the person involved travels from point A to point B in the shortest time possible.</p>
 <p>
 When I started, the trampoline was my best friend. It's easy to do tricks on the trampoline because of the altitude you reach and because failure won't lead to the ER or an ambulance being called.
 </p>
 <p>Safety is important. I would drag most of the pillows out onto the trampoline to avoid fall damage, this would anger my mother. Eventually, we decided to throw certain furniture away, in there was a couch with cushions. It's the best choice for anyone who wants to learn the backflip. Cushions come in different sizes and are stackable, versatile, and will save you from injury. Along with cushions, I used a mattress that we had no use for. </p>
 <p>Online, most athletes mention the three phases of a backflip. These are the takeoff, the tuck, and the landing. </p>
 <p>The takeoff is important, it controls the angle you jump at, the optimal angle is upwards, around 90 degrees from the ground. Jump too far back and the flip is cut short, jump too far forward and you will complete the gainer, a much cooler, but much more risky backflip. Your squat should be at an 85-90 degree angle, this allows for more altitude. The arms should go up in case rotation is not successful, the arms will take the fall. </p>
 <p>Once you are in the air, it is important to use the momentum or inertia from your arms going upwards to bring your knees to your chest, closest to the center of rotation. You should grip your knees with your arms, the rotation should take the least time, this is why it is important to act quickly and release your legs for the landing.  </p>
 <p>Your landing will consist of your legs landing slightly bent, never locked. Even if the flip is low, you will arrive in a frog position, using your arms to brace yourself.  </p>
 <p>Most people would suggest a spotter guiding the flip, which is good practice. I didn't have one so I learned the way described. The most important thing is safety, the fear of falling is what can obscure the successful rotation and cause you to bail mid-way. This fear can be eased by doing the flip on a trampoline or even a mattress. </p>
